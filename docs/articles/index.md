# Welcome to Hauchiwa

Hauchiwa is a flexible static website generator library with incremental rebuilds and cached image optimization.

It is designed to be:

*   **Fast**: Incremental builds mean only changed files are processed.
*   **Flexible**: You define the build pipeline as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of tasks.
*   **Type-safe**: Built in Rust with strict typing for data passing between tasks.

## Why Hauchiwa?

Unlike traditional static site generators that enforce a specific directory structure or build pipeline (like Hugo or Jekyll), Hauchiwa gives you the building blocks to create your own generator. It handles the hard parts—caching, dependency tracking, parallel execution—so you can focus on your site's logic.

Check out [Getting Started](getting-started.html) to build your first site.
